#Hello, myself Parth Parmar, i have created this module for Registration of user
#along with login form as a skill test for PHP Developer.

#I would like to explain the work flow.

#So, basically index.php contains TWO components
# 1) Signup Form
# 2) login Form

#Users can directly enter their data and can proceed for login.
#Whereas, Admin can also login from the same login form.

#Both user and admin has their own role ids by which they get identified by the system. 
#admin role id = 1.
#user role id = 2.

#If admin logins, then he/she will be redirected to "admin.php" page on the contrary
#user will be redirected to "users.php"

#Here is the admin credentials 
#Email = admin@admin.com
#Password = 12345

#Admin can see the list of users and also has the power to move user to trash or delete users.

#Update Function
#User and Admin both can edit their details except password.


#Other
#/Module/partials/_model.php has two classes Users and Admin which has database 
#related functions and can be further extended.
#Also Admin class extends User class.

#Thank You For Reading.
